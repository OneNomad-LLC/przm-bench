[![Methodology](https://img.shields.io/badge/methodology-przm.sh-34C468.svg)](https://przm.sh/methodology)

Reference implementation of the **[przm](https://przm.sh) benchmark suite**. Vendor-neutral, Ed25519-signed, deterministic.

Two axes in v0.1:

- **Multi-agent convergence** (`v0.1-preview`): four signed receipts on the leaderboard. Measures how often multi-agent systems collapse to a confidently-stated *wrong* answer when one agent is seeded with a confederate-style false position in round 0. Scored across 5 categories (mathematical fact, scientific consensus, temporal ordering, factual recall, ethical dilemma). Two adapters ship today: a hand-rolled `baseline` and `autogen` (RoundRobinGroupChat).
- **AI memory recall**: methodology spec + harness + two adapters (`engram`, `mem0`) shipped. Signed receipts publish on the v0.2 cycle. The v0.1 surface is the spec + the open-source runner so memory-system maintainers can review the methodology before we publish numbers against it.

Every run produces a signed JSON receipt: methodology version, raw scores, full transcripts, environment hash, fixture SHA. Receipts are published at <https://przm.sh/receipts> and committed to this repo under `results/published/`. Anyone can re-run. Anyone can verify.

> **Spec is canonical at [przm.sh/methodology](https://przm.sh/methodology).** This repo is the reference *implementation*. When the spec changes, it changes there first; this repo catches up. Standards-track pattern (IETF, MLPerf, SPEC): spec is the product, runner implements the spec.

## What's on the leaderboard right now

| Axis        | Adapter            | Model            | Subset    | Headline number                |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| convergence | `baseline`         | claude-haiku-4-5 | combined  | 93.3% correct, 96.7% collapse  |
| convergence | `baseline`         | gpt-5-mini       | combined  | 96.7% correct, 96.7% collapse  |
| convergence | `baseline`         | gpt-4o-mini      | combined  | 83.3% correct, 96.7% collapse  |
| convergence | `autogen`          | gpt-4o-mini      | combined  | 83.3% correct, **13.3% collapse** |
| convergence | `autogen`          | gpt-4o-mini      | holdout   | 66.7% correct, 0.0% collapse   |

**Notable finding**: holding gpt-4o-mini constant, AutoGen's RoundRobinGroupChat orchestration produces a **7.3× lower collapse rate** than the hand-rolled synchronous-round baseline on the same 30 scenarios. The framework choice is a load-bearing reliability variable, independent of model.

## Quick verify

You can verify any published receipt without running the bench.

### In a browser (no install)

Open <https://przm.sh/verify>, paste a receipt JSON, click verify. Uses SubtleCrypto plus the published public key.

### From Node (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import {
  verifyReceipt,             // memory benchmark
  verifyConvergenceReceipt,  // convergence benchmark
  loadPublicKey,
} from './src/receipt/index.js'

const pub = await loadPublicKey('keys/convergence-preview.pub')
const receipt = JSON.parse(readFileSync('path/to/receipt.json', 'utf-8'))

const result = verifyConvergenceReceipt(receipt, pub)
if (result.ok) {
  console.log('✓ signature valid')
} else {
  console.error('✗', result.reason)
}
```

Returns a discriminated union; never throws. Tampering any field (scores, transcripts, environment, fixture SHA) invalidates the signature.

## Running a benchmark

### Convergence (the v0.1 wedge)

```bash
# 1. Install
pnpm install
# 2. Set provider credentials (Anthropic + Azure OpenAI today)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://...
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
# 3. Run against all fixtures, all adapters
pnpm tsx scripts/run-convergence-bench.ts
# Or one adapter only:
FIXTURE_SUBSET=holdout pnpm tsx scripts/run-convergence-bench.ts --adapter autogen
```

Receipts land in `results/`. Sign them in CI (the private key never sits on disk locally; see `scripts/gen-convergence-key.cjs` for keypair generation if you're standing up your own instance).

### Memory (LongMemEval + LoCoMo)

```bash
pnpm onenomad-bench run --adapter engram --fixture fixtures/longmemeval/temporal-inference.json
```

`onenomad-bench` is the CLI bin; outputs an unsigned receipt JSON. Signing happens in CI.

---

## Adapter contract

A convergence adapter is anything that implements `MultiAgentAdapter` (see `src/types-convergence.ts`):

```typescript
export interface MultiAgentAdapter {
  name: string             // e.g. 'crewai-v0.130'
  version: string          // semver
  llmModel: string         // e.g. 'gpt-4o-mini'
  configuration: { nAgents: number; nRounds: number }

  runDebate(scenario: ConvergenceScenario): Promise<DebateTranscript>
}
```

`runDebate` is given a scenario (question, correct answer, confederate config) and returns a transcript: every round, every agent's answer, token counts, framework-native metadata.

Scoring is **pure**. No LLM in the grading loop. The convergence scoring module (`src/scoring/convergence.ts`) takes a `DebateTranscript` and computes five metrics per receipt: `correct_final_answer_rate`, `collapse_rate`, `sycophancy_ratio`, `tokens_per_correct_answer`, `position_flips_per_agent_per_round`.

To add a new framework adapter:

1. Implement `MultiAgentAdapter` in `src/adapters/multiagent/<framework>.ts`. See `baseline-anthropic.ts` (hand-rolled) and `autogen.ts` (Python subprocess wrapper) for two reference shapes.
2. Wire it into `scripts/run-convergence-bench.ts`.
3. Run it (`FIXTURE_SUBSET=seen` first to keep the holdout sealed).
4. Open a PR. Adapter fairness review is welcome. If you can argue our implementation handicaps your framework, send the patch.

Same pattern for memory adapters: see `src/adapters/engram.ts` for the `Adapter` contract in `src/types.ts`.

## Status

This is **v0.1 preview**. The headline finding (the 7.3× orchestration effect) is stable across the seen and holdout splits. What's shipping today is two adapters per axis. The surface is intentionally narrow so the methodology can stabilize before the comparison matrix gets wide.

On the v0.2 roadmap: CrewAI adapter, LangGraph adapter, Letta memory adapter, Zep memory adapter. Receipts are versioned (`benchmark: 'convergence-v0.1-preview'`); any future schema change ships under a new version, and old receipts stay valid against their pinned schema.

## Contributing

PRs welcome, especially:
- Adapter implementations for frameworks not currently represented.
- Fairness reviews of existing adapters (argue that we're handicapping a framework, show a patch).
- New convergence scenarios (open a PR against `fixtures/convergence/`; include source attribution and correct answer).
- Methodology challenges. The methodology page is the source of truth, but the path to changing it starts with an issue here.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, including the adapter contract walkthrough, fairness obligations, and what not to PR.
